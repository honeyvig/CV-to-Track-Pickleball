----------------
To build a computer vision model that can track pickleball players, balls, and paddles in real-time, we will rely on TensorFlow (and TensorFlow's object detection API) for detecting and tracking objects. The goal of this project would be to capture video frames and track the movement of players, balls, and paddles, providing real-time insights during pickleball training sessions.
Overview of the Approach:

    Data Collection and Annotation: You would first need a dataset of pickleball players, balls, and paddles, annotated for object detection. This includes labeling the positions of players, balls, and paddles in the video frames.
    Model Choice: Use an object detection model like the TensorFlow Object Detection API with a pre-trained model, fine-tuned with your specific pickleball dataset.
    Tracking Algorithm: You can use OpenCV to track objects over multiple frames once they are detected in each individual frame.

Steps to Create the Pickleball Tracking Model

Here’s a Python implementation that outlines how to go about creating the model. This assumes that the TensorFlow Object Detection API is set up and the dataset is annotated properly.
Step 1: Set Up TensorFlow Object Detection API

To get started, install TensorFlow and the necessary dependencies.

pip install tensorflow opencv-python opencv-python-headless
pip install tf_slim tensorflow-object-detection-api

Step 2: Prepare Dataset

Ensure your dataset is labeled in a format that TensorFlow can understand, such as in TFRecord format. You can use tools like LabelImg to annotate the objects in your images (players, balls, and paddles) and convert them into the required format.
Step 3: Train Object Detection Model

    Load Pre-trained Model: We’ll use a pre-trained model, such as ssd_mobilenet_v2, to save time and resources.

import tensorflow as tf
from object_detection.utils import model_util, config_util
from object_detection.protos import pipeline_pb2
from google.protobuf import text_format
from object_detection.utils import config_util

# Path to the model configuration file
pipeline_config = "models/ssd_mobilenet_v2/pipeline.config"

# Load the pipeline config
pipeline_config_proto = pipeline_pb2.TrainEvalPipelineConfig()
with tf.io.gfile.GFile(pipeline_config, "r") as f:
    proto_str = f.read()
    text_format.Merge(proto_str, pipeline_config_proto)

# Update config for training
pipeline_config_proto.model.ssd.num_classes = 3  # Adjust for pickleball classes (players, ball, paddle)
pipeline_config_proto.train_config.batch_size = 4
pipeline_config_proto.train_config.fine_tune_checkpoint = "models/ssd_mobilenet_v2/checkpoint/model.ckpt"
pipeline_config_proto.train_config.fine_tune_checkpoint_type = "detection"

    Train the model: Once the pipeline configuration is set up, you can train the model using the TensorFlow Object Detection API.

# Use the pipeline config to train the model
from object_detection import model_lib_v2

# Set up the training pipeline
config = config_util.create_configs_from_pipeline_proto(pipeline_config_proto)
model = model_util.create_model(config['model'])

# Train the model
model_lib_v2.train_loop(config, model)

Step 4: Inference for Object Detection

Once your model is trained, you can use it to run inference on a video stream. This is where you'll track pickleball players, balls, and paddles.

import cv2
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from object_detection.utils import visualization_utils as vis_util
from object_detection.utils import label_map_util

# Load model and labels
model = tf.saved_model.load('models/ssd_mobilenet_v2/saved_model')
category_index = label_map_util.create_category_index_from_labelmap('models/label_map.pbtxt', use_display_name=True)

# Load video
cap = cv2.VideoCapture('pickleball_match.mp4')

while cap.isOpened():
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    # Run the detection
    input_tensor = np.expand_dims(frame, axis=0)
    input_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(input_tensor, dtype=tf.float32)
    detections = model(input_tensor)

    # Extract detection results
    boxes = detections['detection_boxes'][0].numpy()
    classes = detections['detection_classes'][0].numpy().astype(np.int32)
    scores = detections['detection_scores'][0].numpy()

    # Visualize results
    vis_util.visualize_boxes_and_labels_on_image_array(
        frame,
        boxes,
        classes,
        scores,
        category_index,
        instance_masks=None,
        use_normalized_coordinates=True,
        line_thickness=8)

    # Show the frame with the tracked objects
    cv2.imshow('Pickleball Tracking', frame)

    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

Step 5: Object Tracking Over Time

To track objects (e.g., players, balls, and paddles) between frames, we can apply an object tracking algorithm like SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) or Deep SORT. This helps in associating detected objects with their previous frames.

    Install SORT: You can use the sort package or implement your own tracking algorithm.

pip install sort

    Tracking with SORT:

from sort import Sort

tracker = Sort()

# Loop through the video frames for tracking
while cap.isOpened():
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    # Run object detection
    input_tensor = np.expand_dims(frame, axis=0)
    input_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(input_tensor, dtype=tf.float32)
    detections = model(input_tensor)

    boxes = detections['detection_boxes'][0].numpy()
    scores = detections['detection_scores'][0].numpy()

    # Convert boxes and scores to proper format for SORT
    detection_boxes = boxes[scores > 0.5]
    detection_scores = scores[scores > 0.5]
    detection_boxes[:, 2] -= detection_boxes[:, 0]
    detection_boxes[:, 3] -= detection_boxes[:, 1]

    # Apply SORT for object tracking
    trackers = tracker.update(detection_boxes)

    # Visualize tracked objects
    for track in trackers:
        x1, y1, x2, y2, track_id = track
        cv2.rectangle(frame, (int(x1), int(y1)), (int(x2), int(y2)), (0, 255, 0), 2)
        cv2.putText(frame, f"ID: {int(track_id)}", (int(x1), int(y1) - 10), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.5, (255, 0, 0), 2)

    cv2.imshow('Pickleball Tracking with SORT', frame)

    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

Step 6: Post-Processing and Analytics

After tracking the pickleball objects (players, balls, paddles), you can process the data to generate insights. For instance:

    Player Performance: Analyze the player’s movement patterns, speed, and positioning.
    Ball Tracking: Measure ball trajectory, speed, and position relative to the paddles.
    Event Detection: Detect key events like ball hits, player actions, etc.

This can be done by storing tracking data and performing further analysis or visualization on it.
Summary

    Model: TensorFlow Object Detection API with a pre-trained model like SSD MobileNet.
    Tracking: Using SORT (or DeepSORT) to track objects across video frames.
    Deployment: The system can be deployed to process live video streams or recorded footage.
    Data Insights: Analyze player movement, ball trajectory, and other metrics to improve training sessions.
